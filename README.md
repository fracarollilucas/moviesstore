# moviesstore
This repository is the result of recreating Daniel Correa's and Greg Lim's project as specified in "Django 5 for the Impatient". It comprises of an online movie store, aptly named "Movies Store", where one can create an account, add movies from a pre-existing database to a cart and, naturally, purchase those movies.
